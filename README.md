# A Pirates Life Game
A Pirate's Life Video Game Rules
There are two teams per game: A Home and Away team.
Each team is made up of three pirates, of three different class:                 a Rogue, a Mage, and a Warrior.
There are five rounds per game of alternating attackers and defenders. The away team always gets to attack first. (surprise attack)

***Round 1*** :	Away team performs a surprise attack where each pirate on the team will attack a pirate on the other team. Each pirate 
on the home team will then choose to defend themselves or perform a counter to save a teammate.

***Round 2***:	The Home team will then perform an attack on the away team in retaliation. Both teams will follow the same attack and defense rules as in first round.

***Round 3***:	The Away team will now attack as with the first round.

***Round 4***:	The Home team will then perform their retaliation.
***Round 5***:	This is the Away team’s last chance to defeat the Home team pirates and capture their ship.

***Bonuses***
_Magic staves_ : Bonus damage to Leather armour, base damage to regular.
_Bow & Arrow_ : Bonus damage to Robes and half that bonus damage to Cloaks.
_Swords_ : Bonus damage to Cloak and half that damage to Robes (magical enchantment against metal - linked to bonus magic damage to armour). 
During a Counter attack a pirate only does a percentage (Dex/100) of their original damage  which goes to reducing the damage done to their teammate. 


***Character Stats***
There are Four classes in this game: 
The pirate class is the base class for every other class, hence they all derive from it and each player in the game is a pirate. All pirates have the following 

_base stats_:     	

100 💗 Hit Points (HP) 	30 ⛨ Defense Points (Def)  

50 ⚔ Attack Points (Att)	30 🏃 Dexterity Points (Dex)

All attacks do damage to HP; the sum of players Att determines how much HP is lost in an attack, when a Pirate reach  0HP they are unable to continue playing. Def allows a player to negate damage from an attack on their character; the sum Def determines how much Att is blocked. Dex allows a pirate to perform a counter or sneak attack to defend their teammate. The total amount of Dex determines how much damage the counter does to the attacker and how much is deflected off the pirate’s teammate; they’re both the same value and it is the Dex as a percentage of the Att.
